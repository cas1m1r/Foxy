# Searching
Code for making searching with DuckDuckGo automated, both for searching links and images. 

Will be using images to try and generate some custom datasets for Machine Learning projects. Its typically been hard to find good datasets for unique applications, but with this tool it becomes easy to accumulate thousands of images for a given topics, say "abstract art" and have them organized and ready to go. 

# Emails
:D Everyone should have more email accounts. This code will make it faster to create email accounts on AOL, Protonmail and Outlook (the last is most time efficient).
